## This is redux-shopping cart project made with traditional redux pattern of state management.

Made use of this higher order function:

1. Reducer- Inside of the reducer stay my state recalculation logic
2. Connect- Which is a higher order function in Redux that allow my component to connect to the redux store.
3. mapStateToProps- is a regular javascript function that take state as a parameter and return the state object or whatever to be used as props in my component to display data from the redux store.
4. mapDispatchToProps- is a regular javascript that take possibly to arguments or parameter such as ##dispatch and ##ownProps of that component where i want to use the mapDispatchToProps.
